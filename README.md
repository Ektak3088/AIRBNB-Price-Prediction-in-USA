# AIRBNB-Price-Prediction-in-USA
In this project we take data of Airbnb listings in the USA and try to predict the price of stay in that listing.
The data includes 43167 listings and 29 columns - including log_price, what we are trying to predict.
Preprocessed the data.
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis.
Imputed Missing Data.
Split the data to 75/25 ratio.
Scaled the data with Standard Scaler.
Implemented PCA to reduce dimensionality.
Conducted predictive analysis using various Machine learning Predictive models with Cross-Validation and Grid Search - Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, Linear SVM Regressor, KNN Regressor & SVR with Kernel (Linear, RBF, Poly).
Also, performed ensemble techniques like Bagging, Pasting, Adaboost boosting & Gradient boosing to improve the accuracy of the moels.
Conclusion: Best regression model is KNN Regressor.
